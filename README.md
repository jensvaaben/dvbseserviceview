![appveyor build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/jensvaaben/dvbseserviceview?branch=master&svg=true)

The service view is similar to the service viewer built in [DVBStreamExplorer](http://www.dvbstreamexplorer.com/dvbse/dvbse.php). Unlike [DVBStreamExplorer](http://www.dvbstreamexplorer.com/dvbse/dvbse.php) source code is available so you can modify and improve it exactly to your need.
